# The story behind

As an anti-cheaters enthousiast, I was very hyped at the launch of Valorant and joined the Valorant Police Department discord in July 2020. [Stan Persoon]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/stan-persoons-a8006914a/) a young talent from Belgium was working on the Anti Cheat Police Department website (Shutdown since after Stan left the dev team). I got then invited by [GamerDoc](https://twitter.com/itsgamerdoc?lang=fr) who is working at Riot Vanguard now to work on the Discord Login of the site.
